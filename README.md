# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

This project had the goal of making the Horiseon homepage accessible by introducing semantic HTML elements to the code and alt text to the images. This allows people with disabilities or unreliable internet access to still navigate the page with some ease, and brings the code up to a modern standard that other coders can understand with ease.

## Usage

The webpage can be accessed at https://andreasq99.github.io/Week-01-Challenge/.

The repository for this webpage is located at https://github.com/Andreasq99/Week-01-Challenge/.

The webpage functions as desired; The items in the navigation bar can be clicked to automatically take you to different sections of the webpage, and all images can be inspected to reveal alt-text.

Here is a screenshot of the webpage.
